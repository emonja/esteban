<h1>YO SOY</h1>
<p class="small">Discussion & Philosophical Notes — v01</p>

<hr>

<h2>How to Use These Notes</h2>

<p>
These notes are not meant to be read aloud or delivered verbatim.
They exist as anchors for discussion, reflection, and future writing.
</p>

<p>
The experience always comes first.  
Language comes after.
</p>

<p>
Instructors are encouraged to select fragments, questions, or ideas
and let discussion emerge organically.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>1. Presence Without Introduction</h2>

<p>
YO SOY replaces verbal self-introduction with sonic presence.
Participants are not asked to describe themselves.
They are asked to exist.
</p>

<div class="block">
<h3>Discussion Prompts</h3>
<ul>
  <li>What does it mean to be present without speaking?</li>
  <li>Did you feel more or less exposed than in a verbal introduction?</li>
  <li>Was the sound “you”, or something external?</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
Language often performs identity rather than revealing it.
Sound here does not represent the self — it occupies space.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>2. Claiming Space vs Asking Permission</h2>

<p>
Participants are instructed to use device speakers and raise volume.
This instruction is symbolic, not technical.
</p>

<div class="block">
<h3>Discussion Prompts</h3>
<ul>
  <li>How did it feel to be audible to everyone?</li>
  <li>Did you hesitate before raising the volume?</li>
  <li>Did you feel you were bothering others?</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
Personal devices usually privatize experience.
Headphones create isolation bubbles.
</p>

<p>
YO SOY temporarily reverses this logic:
sound becomes public again, and space must be negotiated.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>3. Involuntary Contribution and Ethical Friction</h2>

<p>
No one “plays” the instrument.
Everyone contributes by being present.
</p>

<div class="block">
<h3>Discussion Prompts</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Did you feel in control of your contribution?</li>
  <li>Did you want to stop at any point?</li>
  <li>Did you feel responsible for the collective sound?</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
Many real-world systems work this way:
participation is not optional, only influence varies.
</p>

<p>
YO SOY makes this structure audible.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>4. Individuality Inside a Collective Field</h2>

<p>
Each participant produces a different sound,
but no sound is privileged.
</p>

<div class="block">
<h3>Discussion Prompts</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Could you clearly distinguish your own sound?</li>
  <li>Did individuality matter once the room filled?</li>
  <li>Did you listen to others, or just perceive noise?</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
Individuality often assumes isolation to be legible.
In a shared field, difference exists but salience dissolves.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>5. Agency vs Control</h2>

<p>
Participants answer questions, but the system does not fully obey.
</p>

<div class="block">
<h3>Discussion Prompts</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Did the instrument feel responsive to your choices?</li>
  <li>Did you trust the system to reflect you accurately?</li>
  <li>How did you react when it didn’t?</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
This exposes a key distinction:
agency is the feeling of influence,
control is actual power over outcomes.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>6. The Glitch as Meaning</h2>

<p>
Certain system failures are documented rather than fixed.
</p>

<div class="block">
<h3>Discussion Prompts</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Did you notice inconsistencies?</li>
  <li>Did you assume they were intentional?</li>
  <li>Did they change your trust in the system?</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
Glitches reveal hidden assumptions and system boundaries.
They are epistemological events, not just technical errors.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>7. Silence Is Not Neutral</h2>

<p>
Once the system starts, silence is no longer available.
</p>

<div class="block">
<h3>Discussion Prompts</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Was silence possible?</li>
  <li>Did silence feel like absence or refusal?</li>
  <li>Who benefits from silence in shared systems?</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
Silence is often framed as neutral,
but it can function as privilege, withdrawal, or protection.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>8. No Failure, No Performance</h2>

<p>
There is no correct output and no evaluation.
</p>

<div class="block">
<h3>Discussion Prompts</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Did the lack of success criteria feel freeing or unsettling?</li>
  <li>Were you waiting for feedback?</li>
  <li>Did you feel exposed anyway?</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
Removing performance often reveals how deeply performance logic is internalized.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>9. Data, Memory, and Recognition</h2>

<p>
The system remembers participants, but recognition is subtle.
</p>

<div class="block">
<h3>Discussion Prompts</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Does being stored mean being recognized?</li>
  <li>Is memory the same as acknowledgment?</li>
  <li>Who decides when memory matters?</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
Digital systems excel at storage, not meaning.
A system can remember you perfectly and still ignore you.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>10. Toward Stage 2</h2>

<p>
Stage 1 centers individuals.
Future stages will remove that center.
</p>

<div class="block">
<h3>Speculative Prompts</h3>
<ul>
  <li>What happens when control is taken away?</li>
  <li>Should individuals consent to losing agency?</li>
  <li>Can collectives act ethically?</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
The discomfort of Stage 1 is preparation, not accident.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Instructor Note</h2>

<p>
Do not rush interpretation.
Let discomfort sit before analysis.
Avoid explaining intent too early.
</p>

<p>
Your role is not to resolve meaning,
but to host reflection.
</p>
